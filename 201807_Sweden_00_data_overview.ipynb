    "In the summer of 2018, a large number of wildfires (primarily forest fires) occurred throughout much of Sweden. According to the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, they are the most serious in the country in modern history. The summer was unusually warm and dry, significantly raising the risk of fire. Firefighters from multiple countries were involved in fighting the fires. Many people were evacuated from their homes, but there were no fatalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several of the fires were started by people using disposable barbecues, though bans on these were in place due to the weather conditions. Some were started by lightning strikes. Wildfires also occurred in the neighbouring countries Denmark, Finland and Norway, but no casualties due to wildfires were reported in Scandinavia.\n",
    "(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Sweden_wildfires).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Active fires\n",
    "Most of the active fires detected by the MODIS instruments was in the far west of Attica, close to the border with Corinthia, with a weaker signal detected in the eastern coastal region of Attica on 23/24 July."
