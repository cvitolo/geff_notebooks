    "Beside using harmonised danger classes, it is possible to use statistical methods to define critical danger levels for small areas, or even at the cell-size level. These methods are based on the definition of a local climatology and some countries, like Italy and Portugal, tend to make use of locally calculated danger levels in addition to the harmonised ones suggested by EFFIS to get a feel of how common the current fire weather is compared to the local climatology. In this tutorial we are going to show how to compute local danger classes.\n",

    "To assess the climatology of a given area, we are going to make use of the ERA5-based HRES reanalysis for a standard 30-year period: from 1981-01-01 to 2010-12-31. If we try to request the datacube directly from the CDS we will get an error because the data volume is too large. Best way is to write a custom application using the Toolbox of the Copernicus Climate Data Store: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/toolbox-editor/1117/download_hres_bbox (only accessible to logged-in users).\n",

For the interested readers, a computationally efficient way to subset a large datacube is to use CDO (Climate Data Operator). The command to subset a datacube over Portugal is: `cdo sellonlatbox,350.18,353.81,36.78,42.15 fwi_1981_2010.nc fwi_1981_2010_attica.nc` "
